<h3>Definition of different types of web servers.</h3>

<p>Below is a definition of the different types of web servers that can be found in a datat centre.</p>

	<h3>Shared</h3>
	<p>Shared hosting refers to the practice of having multiple websites hosted on the one machine. The Hard Drive is partitioned for each website, and serverside software handles which site data to send out for each request made to the machine's IP.<br />
	This allows for websites to cut down on the costs of running an individual machine by sharing them among the other users of said machine.</p>
	
	<h3>Co-Location</h3>
	<p>Co-Location hosting refers to the practice of owning a server machine which resides in a Data Centre from which you rent the space, connection, power, cooling, and physical security for your server.<br />
	This frees up the technicians' time to work on matters which more directly pertain to your business needs.</p>
	
	<h3>VPS</h3>
	<p>Virtual Private Server hosting refers to the practice of having multiple Operating Systems residing on the one server machine, which are individually use-able by customers. They function in the same way as a dedicated server, but with more than one of them per server machine.<br />
	This means that while the performance of the machine is being shared out across multiple OS Instances, the functionality remains near equal to that of a dedicated server, with a reduced cost.</p>
	
	<h3>Dedicated</h3>
	<p>Dedicated hosting refers to the practice of a client leasing an entire server machine which only they utilise. They tend to have full control over the server from the OS to the function.<br />
	This degree of control comes with a proportional increase in expense.</p>
