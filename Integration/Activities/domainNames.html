		<h1>Domain Names</h1>

		<h2>AuDA</h2>

		<h3>Registrars</h3>
		<p>Registrars are the organisations/ commercial entities which manage the reservation of Internet Domain Names.<br />
		They are the interface between the public and the Domain Name Registries (the servers upon which domain name information resides). </p>

		<p>To become a registrar, an organisation/ commercial entity must first be accredited by a Generic Top Level Domain Registry and/ or a Country Code Top Level Domain Registry, who will then allow the registrar to purchase domain names from them on behalf of the end-user.</p>

		<p>The costs involved in being a registrar are:<br />
		The cost of purchasing the domain name from the registry at wholesale price (including fees to both AusRegistry and AuDA) which is usually covered by the end-user who also provides the profit, depending on how much the Registrar inflates the price from Wholesale, the cost of the AuDA Annual Registrar License Fee ($3,300/yr), and a one time payment of $2,200 accreditation fee.</p>

		<h3>Who Is</h3>
		<p>Whois.com.au is an Identity Provider. In addition to providing; domain registrations, web hosting, site building, email hosting and digital certificates... whois.com.au provides the public with the ability to look up the Identity of any site the user provides. This service returns a bevy of information on the domain's registration details, while respecting the privacy of the domain's owner. </p>

		<h3>Domain Name Drop List</h3>
		<p>The Domain Name Drop List is the list of expired domain names that are due to be purged from the Registry. Once this occurs, the domain becomes openly available to be registered as though it were never registered originally. Domain names on the Drop List are purged at the next Purge Cycle. These tend to occur daily.</p>

		<h3>Rules for Registering a .com.au Domain Name</h3>
		<p>The rules for Registering a .com.au Domain Name are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>You or your business must be: An Australian registered company; or trading under a registered business name in any Australian State or Territory; or an Australian partnership or sole trader; or a foreign company licensed to trade in Australia; or an owner of an Australian Registered Trade Mark; or an applicant for an Australian Registered Trade Mark; or an association incorporated in any Australian State or Territory; or an Australian commercial statutory body. </li>
		<li>The domain must be: an exact match, abbreviation or acronym of the registrant’s name or trademark; or otherwise closely and substantially connected to the registrant, in accordance with the categories of “close and substantial connection” set out in the Guidelines on the Interpretation of Policy Rules for the Open 2LDs.</li>

		<li>The domain name may also be registered in the com.au 2LD under paragraph 2(b) for the purpose of domain monetisation, in accordance with the explanation of “domain monetisation” set out in the Guidelines on the Interpretation of Policy Rules for the Open 2LDs, provided that the content on the website to which the domain name resolves must be related specifically and predominantly to subject matter denoted by the domain name; and the domain name must not be, or incorporate, an entity name, personal name or brand name in existence at the time the domain name was registered.</li>
		<li>The domain must not already be in-use</li>
		<li>The domain may not contain a name on the AuDA's Reserved Names List</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What makes a good/bad Domain Name?</h3>
		<p>A good domain name is one which is both easy to remember, and easy to type. The shorter the better, whilst retaining as much intrinsic meaning as possible. A bad domain name is one which is difficult to remember, and/or difficult to type, and/or highly ambiguous and/or generic.</p>

		<h2>Domain Name Scams</h2>
		<p>Domain Name Scams is the term used to refer to the practice of a Domain Name Registrar attempting to trick/co-erce businesses into buying, listing or converting a Domain Name.<br />
		One method of Domain Scamming, known as Domain Slamming, is when a Registrar attempts to trick a domain owner into switching over to them from their existing Registrar by convincing the domain owner into thinking they are simply renewing their domain with their current Registrar.</p>

		<h2>Cost analysis of Domain Names</h2>
		<p>Super-cheap Domain Names are often too good to be true, and super-expensive ones are often a rip-off. A typical mark-up from the wholesale price of $18.15, would be anywhere from a $5-15 increase. Anything more and it is not worth what you are being charged. Any less and they will undoubtedly attempt to make an equal or greater profit off you in some other area. I would recommend netregistry. They seem reasonably competent and fall within the tolerable mark-up zone.</p>
